Do people tend to choose more atypical objects when prompted with a novel word?

Participants' choices on familiar word (e.g., "leaf") vs. novel word (e.g., "neft") trials. Higher values indicate they chose more atypical items. Stimuli typicality scored by experimenter on a binary scale. People choose more atypical exemplars when prompted with a novel compared to a familiar word. They also strongly prefer typical exemplars when prompted with familiar words.

```{r}
glmer(typicality ~ condition + (1|participant_id), family = "binomial",
      data = data) %>%
  tidy()
```

```{r}
data <- data %>%
  group_by(participant_id, trial_number) %>%
  mutate(distinct_types = n_distinct(stimulus_subclass) - 1) %>%
  ungroup() 

data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = condition, y = distinct_types)) +
  geom_violin() +
  ylab("one type                          two types")
  
```

Do people tend to choose more varied objects when prompted with familiar vs. novel words? Another way to tell whether people think the meaning of a novel word is narrower is to test whether they choose one subtype (e.g., bean-shaped leaves) vs. multiple subtypes (e.g., teardrop-shaped and oak-shaped leaves). 

Above, participants' choices of exemplars; they have two choices on each trial. A score of 0 reflects that they chose all of one subtype, and a score of 1 reflects that they chose two distinct subtypes. People tend to choose fewer distinct subtypes when prompted with novel words.

```{r}
glmer(distinct_types ~ condition + (1|participant_id), family = "binomial",
      data = data) %>%
  tidy()
```

```{r}
data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = condition, y = typicality)) + 
  geom_violin() +
  facet_wrap(~category) +
  ylab("typical                          atypical")
```
